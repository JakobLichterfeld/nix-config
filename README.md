Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

After using a shell script to automate my desktop Ubuntu installation from 2011 to 2023, I finally migrated the 2646 lines of code to Ansible, see https://github.com/JakobLichterfeld/infra-playbook

End of 2023 I migrated to Nix.

## MainDev (Mac)

Managed using `nix-darwin` and `home-manager`. Impure packages and apps are managed by `homebrew` and `mas`
